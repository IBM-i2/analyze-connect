# Welcome

Welcome to the GitHub home page for the i2 Connect gateway. The examples in
this repository demonstrate how to create and configure connectors that
retrieve data from external sources.

In a deployment of i2 Analyze that uses the i2 Connect gateway, a _connector_
transforms data from an external source into entity and link records that
conform to an i2 Analyze schema, to be viewed and analyzed in IBM i2 Analyst's
Notebook Premium.

When you implement a connector, you develop _services_ that allow analysts to
perform parameterized searches to find records based on conditions, and
seeded searches to find records that are connected to other records.

The example connectors in this repository provide services that can be used to
search all the data in an external source, or a subset of the data that
satisfies a set of specified conditions. The connectors also perform
server-side validation to prohibit invalid requests.
